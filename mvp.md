# Predicting A Film's Lifetime Gross Earnings
The goal of this project is to analyze which factors affect a film's lifetime gross earnings and how to use that information in order to help a investor decided whether or not they should invest in that movie.

After running a correlation between lifetime gross earnings and some of the variables that might affect it, I plotted a heat map and saw that domestic opening (money earned on the movie's opening day) had the highest correlation with a movie's lifetime gross earnings. This can be explained by the hype building up around the movie prior to its release date.

I also plotted a pair plot, to better visualize the correlation between different variables and a movie's lifetime gross earnings.

As you can see, there is an extremely strong correlation between a movie's domestic opening and it's lifetime gross earnings.
